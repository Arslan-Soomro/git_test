Hi, I am Arslan, The Novelist.

There is A Guy Walking Alone,
Around The Castle, He Runs Very Fast And Jumps,
Suddely He Sees Sharp Stone Sticking Out Of The Castle Wall That He Was About To Hit.

The guy dodges the stone, but a knight sees him and comes chasing him, the boy panicked and jumped in the river nearby
and vanished into deep water away from the knight but closer to death.
